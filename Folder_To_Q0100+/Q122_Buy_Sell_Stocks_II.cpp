/*
Initially, I thought of iterating backward, similar toBest Time to Buy and Sell Stock 1, where I tracked the highest price.
But here, since multiple transactions are allowed, I realized that instead of tracking only one max profit, I needed to sum up every profitable transaction.;P
So, I focused on adding profits whenever there was an increase in price. ðŸ˜Ž
